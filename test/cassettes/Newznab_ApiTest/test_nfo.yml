        INFO***********************\nA. We don''t do 720p Rls yet. Our ISP bandwidth
        limitations does not permit it, So stop asking. Most sites barely want the
        documentary, Reality, etc that done now in SD, definitely not 720p taking
        up site space. We focus on rlsing stuff that is over look and missed so at
        leasts its out there. If you want to do the 720s go ahead...have at it.\n&\nB.
        Thanks for catching our Flaws and making us an even better GROUP\n","enclosure":{"@attributes":{"url":"https:\/\/api.newznab.com\/api?t=getnfo&id=d63ae95ed6c5315a33fcb3a76ed838b9&raw=1&i=185135&r=7e8896464895c1cde33759b8307f5cf8","length":"826","type":"text\/x-nfo"}}}}}'
